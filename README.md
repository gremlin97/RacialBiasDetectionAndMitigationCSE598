# Exploring Racial Bias and Bias Amplification in Vision Models and Datasets

This repository contains code for my CSE598: Machine Learning Fairness and Security Final Project. The goal of this project is to detect racial bias, calculate model leakage, and dataset leakage and finally mitigate this Racial Bias in Vision Models. All the code for this project would be found in the IPYNB notebook in the repo with relevant comments, sections, Colab link and supporting project report. To run this, the only files required other than the Colab notebook are:

* COCO Demographic annotations found at this link: https://princetonvisualai.github.io/imagecaptioning-bias/

* COCO 2014 train annotations JSON file

For any issues regarding the code please mail me at: kkasodek@asu.edu
